Oops, how are you? My name is Maisterzin and this is another one of my projects! I made a login page with a Base code that AI <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">Chat GPT</a> created and modified and stylized it! I put some additional systems such as:

- Gradient Background

- Dark Theme Button

- Styling in the Buttons

- Extra texts

See below the GPT CHAT Code and Mine:
